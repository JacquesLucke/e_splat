<p><strong>Welcome to e-Splat, before being able to continue with the study, you must first read through this information sheet to check whether you agree to continue with the study. The questionnaires will only load after you have ticked the boxes to confirm your age and that you consent to take part in the following study.</strong></p>

<p>This study has been approved by the Exeter Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<p>We are conducting research to help us develop a new format of Social Media and gaming.</p>

<p>This will involve creating a personalised profile (including a photograph and some information about yourself), and then playing a computerised game on an online platform with other participants. For the game, you are able to select other players based on how similar they are to you, or how much you desire to play with them. If they select you in return, you will be entered into a game of either 6, 4, 3, or 2 players.</p>

<p>During the study you will be asked questions about your current social media usage to gain an insight into the current popularity of various social media platforms, in addition to looking at the current size of your social media network. Finally you will be asked questions about how you found the new social media gaming platform, whether you would be likely to use it in the future, and how playing it affected your mood.</p>

<p>At any time if you do not wish to continue with the study you may withdraw without penalty, by simply exiting the online window. In the event that you do this, your results will be destroyed and will not be used during data analysis.</p>

<p>As mentioned, you may be asked to provide some personal information to create your "profile". This will include uploading a photograph and describing your hobbies and personality in three words. Additionally, you may be asked to provide general demographic information about yourself in the questionnaires (e.g. age, gender). However, no information that you share will be traceable back to you. Once the profile you have created for your trial has been used, it will be destroyed after you end your trial. The information you provide will remain strictly confidential.</p>

<p>If you are unable to tick all the boxes below, then please exit this window. You will not be able to continue with the study.</p>

<p>If you are happy with the above information and wish to participate, please tick each of the below boxes.</p>
