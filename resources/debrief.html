<p><strong>Thank you for taking part in this study. Please take a few minutes to read this page explaining the true nature of this study.</strong></p>

<p>This study is testing whether people who regularly use social media experience increased negative response to social exclusion. The purpose of the game you played was to stimulate social rejection; the other players were not real, and were set up to socially exclude you.</p>

<p>The reason we felt the need to conduct this study is because we have seen a boom in the number of mood disorders, which mirrors the rise in excessive social media use. The use of technology and social media has increased exponentially over the last 10 years, and research has shown that addiction to social media can cause increased feelings of loneliness and social exclusion, which in turn can lead to elevated feelings of low mood (Yao & Zhong 2014, Kim, Ryu, Chon, Yeun et al, 2006). This leads us to question whether young people in the UK are using excessive amounts of social media, and whether this is leading to a heightened sensitivity to social exclusion. If people who are addicted to social media experience a greater drop in mood as a result of social exclusion, this might offer another explanation for the simultaneous boom in social media use and mood disorders that we have seen over the last 15 years (NHS.UK).</p>

<p>In this study, we wanted to investigate whether there is a link between how much you use social media and how sensitive you are to being socially excluded. You have not been playing a game with other participants, but rather you have been playing with computerised false "participants" who have been programmed to exclude you from games. All participants entering this study have encountered the same experience and we would like to make it clear that this has nothing to do with the personal information you submitted in your "profile". Your profile will be deleted as soon as you exit this window.</p>

<p>Your participation will enhance the understanding on how social media may be contributing to mood disorders, which has received little research. This could help inform future treatment aimed at reducing dependency on Social Media in line with the current increase in technology.</p>

<p>Upon completion of this study it is normal to experience a slightly lowered mood, however this is likely to be of a transient nature. If you would like to elevate your mood then we have included a link to a short video that has previously been shown to enhance positive mood. Please follow the link below should you wish to watch this. </p>

<p>Thank you again for your participation in this study.</p>
